- **d02** - Multi-threading and Async Processing (Threads, ExecutorService, CompletableFuture)
- **d03** - Clean Coding Principles
- **d04** - Unit and Integration Testing

## Hands-On Exercises

Each module includes practical exercises with progressive difficulty:

- **d01/01-functional-programming/hands-on-work** - 30 exercises covering functional interfaces, Optional, and Streams API
- **d02/hands-on-work** - 40 exercises on threading basics, ExecutorService, CompletableFuture, and advanced async patterns
- **d03/clean-coding-hands-on-work** - 25 refactoring exercises addressing clean code issues (magic numbers, long methods, duplication, etc.)
- **d04/01-unit-and-integration-testing** - 35 unit testing exercises covering CRUD operations with Mockito and JUnit 5
